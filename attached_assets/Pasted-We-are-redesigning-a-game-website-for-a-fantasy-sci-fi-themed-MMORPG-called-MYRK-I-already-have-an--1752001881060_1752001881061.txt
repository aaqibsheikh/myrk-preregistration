We are redesigning a game website for a fantasy-sci-fi themed MMORPG called MYRK. I already have an existing repo with a basic layout (Next.js + Tailwind), but now I want to rebuild and enhance it completely with immersive design, gamified features, and animation.

🎯 Goal:
Create a beautiful, immersive, and interactive pre-launch marketing website that reflects the mystical, lore-driven world of MYRK. It should feel like part of the game world and not just a flat site. Use modern UI practices, smooth animations, and interactive elements.

🧩 Sections to Build:
Hero Section

Background video or animated banner

Game tagline or short lore teaser

2 CTA buttons: “Pre-Register” and “Join Discord”

Smooth scroll navigation

The Frozen Vault (Gamified Unlockables)

Lore-themed vault section where users complete tasks (like signing up, sharing, or solving riddles)

Show rewards (wallpapers, OSTs, secret lore, cosmetics)

Task tracking UI

Integrate with Firebase (optional for tracking completion)

AI Chat Companion – “Myrk the Prophet”

Floating chatbot on the site with 2 modes:

Cryptic Mode: replies in character (mysterious lore hints)

Direct Mode: simple site navigation or FAQ

In-character dialogue, floating avatar style, subtle animations

Signal From The Void – Newsletter Widget

Sci-fi styled section for newsletter signup

Look like a signal beacon or cosmic transmission

CTA like: “Align With the Signal”

Include email field and submit button

Use Mailgun or Firebase

Game Overview Section

Brief paragraph about MYRK’s world and mission

Optionally animated illustrations or static concept art

CTA: “Learn More” or “Explore Lore”

Features Grid

Grid or slider to showcase:

Open World

Multiplayer

AR mechanics

NFT/Token Ecosystem

Each item with icon, title, short description

Teaser Video Section

Embed YouTube trailer (or placeholder)

CTA: “Watch Trailer” or “Coming Soon”

Roadmap (Optional)

Timeline design with milestones

Include animations or reveal scroll effects

Footer

Discord, Twitter, Telegram icons

Company info

Terms/Privacy

💡 Design Style:
Dark mode first

Use a fantasy + sci-fi hybrid theme (like mysterious, ancient tech)

Smooth transitions, hover effects, section reveals

Use Framer Motion for animations

Tailwind CSS for utility styling

Fonts: modern + fantasy themed mix

🧠 Tech Stack:
Next.js

Tailwind CSS

Framer Motion (or GSAP)

Firebase (for auth and task tracking)

Mailgun or SendGrid for newsletter

Optional: GPT API or custom rules for AI chatbot

🔄 Notes:
You can reuse layout or structure from existing repo.

Keep mobile responsiveness.

Focus on gamified interactions, deep lore feel, and animation polish.

Don’t need backend admin panel for now — just frontend experience.
