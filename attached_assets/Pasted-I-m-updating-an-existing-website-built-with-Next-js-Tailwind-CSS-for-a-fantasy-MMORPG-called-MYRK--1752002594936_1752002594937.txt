I'm updating an existing website built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS for a fantasy MMORPG called MYRK.

Please only add the following sections or components if they are not already implemented in the project. Do not replace or remove any existing working sections or styles.

🧊 Add If Missing:
Hero Section Enhancements

If not already present:

Add animated or video background.

Add a short lore-style tagline.

Add 2 buttons: “Pre-Register” and “Join Discord”.

Add smooth scroll navigation for section links.

Newsletter Signup – “Signal from the Void”

If newsletter form doesn’t exist:

Add a new section styled like a cosmic transmission.

Include an email input and submit button.

Title: “Align with the Signal”.

Hook it up to Firebase or Mailgun (optional).

Features Grid

If there is no grid showing game features:

Add a responsive 2x2 grid showing:

Open World

Multiplayer

AR Mechanics

Token/NFT Ecosystem

Each item should include icon, title, and short description.

Teaser Video Section

If no video section exists:

Add a section with an embedded YouTube trailer.

Add CTA: “Watch Trailer” or “Coming Soon”.

Game Overview Section

If not already included:

Add a short game description section.

Optionally include an animated image or background.

CTA: “Learn More” or “Explore Lore”.

Frozen Vault Section (Gamified Unlockables)

If not present:

Add a themed “Vault” section where users see tasks and rewards.

Show tasks like: sign up, share, solve puzzle (UI only).

Show possible rewards like wallpapers, comics, cosmetics.

No backend needed — only layout and placeholder behavior.

Floating Chatbot Placeholder – “Myrk the Prophet”

If chatbot or floating helper doesn’t exist:

Add a floating button: “Chat with Myrk”.

On click, show a box with text: “Coming Soon – Myrk the Prophet will guide you.”

Use animations or subtle glowing orb effect (optional).

Footer

If not already present:

Add Discord, Twitter, Telegram icons.

Add placeholder text for: Company Info, Terms, and Privacy links.

🎨 Styling Guidelines (Only If Not Done Yet):
Use dark mode as default.

Use fantasy + sci-fi hybrid design (mystical and futuristic).

Add Framer Motion animations for smooth scroll/entry.

Use Tailwind CSS utilities for layout.

Use a mix of modern and fantasy fonts if not already styled.

✅ Final Notes:
Do not modify existing components unless incomplete.

Only add new sections if they are clearly missing.

Keep everything responsive and clean.

Focus only on frontend layout and animation, not backend logic for now.
